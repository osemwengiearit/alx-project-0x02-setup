# Next.js Project Setup and Basics

Welcome to the **ALX Project 0x02: Setup** repository!

This repository serves as the foundation for building a modern web application using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **ESLint**. The goal of this setup is to provide a clean, scalable, and developer-friendly structure for future development.

## ðŸ”§ Whatâ€™s Included

- Next.js with TypeScript support
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- ESLint for consistent code quality
- Aliased import paths using `@/*`
- Well-structured project layout with reusable components

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Iâ€™ll scaffold this project using:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest alx-project-0x02 --typescript --eslint --tailwind
```
